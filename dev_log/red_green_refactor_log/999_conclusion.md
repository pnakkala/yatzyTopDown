# The end

**Pros**
- clear set of acceptance tests describing the application's behaviour
- e2e tests rarely need to change when implementations change

**Cons**
- code 'churn' - harder for teams to do top-down TDD?

**Good for**
- designing software
- writing readable code & tests
- specifying expected end-user application behaviour as runnable tests (BDD?)

**Doesn't help**
- designing good software
- test coverage, eg. unit testing corner cases

**Future work**
- Try this in an existing project
    - more dependencies
    - multiple people working in the same code base
    - what does the 'walking skeleton' look like for a new feature in an
      existing codebase?
